gSHELL is a bash-like shell designed to mimic a standard terminal session but with some added features. </br>
The shell can be run from the command line. A list of features can be found below, or by typing "help" after running gshell.

== FEATURES ==
- exiting by typing exit or ctrl-d
- cd [directory] works as expected but requires an argument
- help gives help with the new features
- history shows all commands entered while in the shell
- last shows the last command. entering last again shows the next last, ect..
- execute executes the command that last has showed. If last was never used, nothing happens.
